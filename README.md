# Rain_Harvest
App for rain harvesting to sustain water availability and also exploring it as an additional source of income<br/>
## Submission or Project Name<br/>
Our project stands for Rain_Harvest as a mandatory and most less sighted technique to be adopted to get rid of water scarcity.This submission holds for WitAce 2021.<br/>
## Short Description<br/>
### What's the problem?<br/>
The major problem that we are witnessing is water scarcity. Water shortage is what major portion of the society is facing and needs to be curb as soon as possible.<br/>
Also with this we can also make conservation an employment for us.<br/>
### How can technology help?<br/>
Technology is the most powerful tool when we talk about its role in sustainnility.We have used technology to not only spread awareness about rain water harvesting by analysis is pofitability.
### The idea<br/>
The idea is to make rain water harvesting mandatory for each one of us so that people living in arrid region can get benefitted.
Also with this we would also be reducing the unemployability in our country.<br/>
### The architecture<br/>

archit.PNG<br/>
1. The user would first navigate to analyse the weather to optimise and refractor its rain harvesting system.<br/>
2. Go to choose the type of residential area we live in.<br/>
3. Get require information on types of rainwater harvesting.(text would be read aloud by watson).<br/>
4. Go to scale profit to see profitability obtained.<br/>
### Long description<br/>
##### RAIN-HARVEST <br/>

Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is the collection and storage of rain, rather than allowing it to run off. Rainwater is collected from a roof-like surface and redirected to a tank, cistern, deep pit (well, shaft, or borehole), aquifer, or a reservoir with percolation, so that it seeps down and restores the ground water. <br/>

##### WATER SCARCITY (PROBLEM) <br/>

 There is lowering of water table in a number of villages in Haryana, Punjab and western Uttar Pradesh due to irrigation practices in these areas. 

In arid regions like Rajasthan already water scarcity is seen on a large scale. 

There is a great demand of water in industries . 

There is large-scale pollution of water as a result of industrialisation and urbanisation. <br/>

##### CONSEQUENCES <br/>

Water scarcity may lead to migration waves.

If proper measures are not taken timely these scarcities lead to severe conditions like Drought which further causes life loss. 

If this condition continues the Earth will soon become unfit for living. <br/>

##### WATER CONSERATION <br/>

Rain water harvesting: One of the most effective methods of water management and water conservation. <br/>

            Broadly there are two ways of harvesting rainwater <br/>

 

   1. Surface runoff harvesting <br/>

In urban area rainwater flows away as surface runoff. This runoff could be caught and used for recharging aquifers by adopting appropriate methods. <br/>

 

      2. Rooftop rainwater harvesting <br/>

It is a system of catching rainwater where it falls. In rooftop harvesting, the roof becomes the catchments, and the rainwater is collected from the roof of the house/ building. It can either be stored in a tank or diverted to artificial recharge system. This method is less expensive and very effective and if implemented properly helps in augmenting the groundwater level of the area. <br/>

 

 

##### SOLUTION <br/>

We have come up with a solution of RAIN HARVESTING. <br/>

And to make it easily accessible to all we have developed an app. <br/>

 You  got our app that will let you know about how you could implement Rainwater Harvesting <br/>

###### Key features of our app <br/>

1.Real time analysis of weather (with sea and ground level water table readings to let you know whether or not its economical and beneficial for you to implement rainwater harvesting). <br/>

2. We have used Watson text to speech service and Openweather.org API in this application. <br/>

 

3.Choose the type of harvesting depending upon the region you live (i.e. rural or urban). <br/>

4.Get the required information and grab the key principles of this technique.<br/> 

5.Scale your profit by the inbuilt calculator that will estimate your rainwater harvesting potential with runoff coefficient of 0.8. <br/>

6.Earn at your space just by utilising and storing the essential drops of life by providing it to the people in dire need.<br/> 

 

##### RESULT: <br/>

Water can be conserved easily in an efficient manner and thus we can avoid water scarcity.<br/> 

 

##### CONCLUSION <br/>

By our app rain water can easily be conserved plus one can make a good profit too. <br/>
